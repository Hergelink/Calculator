# Calculator
🧮 A clone Iphone calculator app 📱


💼 Quirks & Features

- Unlike an Iphone calculator my calculator displays all the numbers and signs that will be calculated.
- After the 5th & 11th character the font size will decrease by half to be able to fit more characters in display.(There are some bugs regarding this feature!)


🕴️ Why did I built it?
 
 - This calculator application is special to me because it was the first time that I come up with an idea, destructured the components
 and made it a reality on my own. 
 - After completion(with of course some 🐛's) I became confident that i was able to build a simple(yet complex for me🙃) idea 
   and most importantly that I came a long road when I first started learning to code 5 month's ago.
